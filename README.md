## About
Ratventure is a simple and fun role-playing game.

You are The Hero. The world is being invaded by the Rat King and his endless minions. The only way to defeat the Rat King is to find the Orb of Power, and then destroy the Rat King in combat. Since you have the ability to sense the Orb of Power, only you can save the world.

In this computer role-playing game, you will travel around a grid map searching for the Orb of Power and fighting minions. On the map are various towns where you can rest and buy weapons. Once you find the Orb of Power, destroy the Rat King to win the game.
